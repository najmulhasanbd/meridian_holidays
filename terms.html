                right to cancel the booking immediately and block the email, phone number that is associated with that
                particular account from our website. Cosmos Holiday reserves the right to take legal action if needed,

                request you to contact our customer service with proper verifiable documents.



                Ticket Delivery

                Most tickets are electronic (e-Tickets), however with certain itineraries where an e-Ticket is not
                available a paper ticket will be issued. If an e-Ticket could not be issued for a particular reservation
                or if a delivery was being made of another product or service, Cosmos Holiday will send the paper
                ticket, product or service through a secure mode of delivery (a reputable carrier company). Cosmos
                Holiday does not assume any responsibility for the fault of the delivery company. We will attempt to
                redeliver but do not provide any guarantees for redelivery on time. If you provide an incorrect address,
                then you may have to pay excess fees to the delivery company for alteration of the address. If an
                e-Ticket is generated the ticket information will be available on the Site.



                Credit/Debit Card Payments

                a. All credit cards must have a verifiable Bangladesh or other country billing address.

                b. All bookings and fares are not guaranteed until ticketed by the supplier. For hotels, flight, and
                vacation packages, bookings are not guaranteed unless you receive a confirmation number by email.

                c. When you submit your credit or debit card for a purchase, we request an authorization for the amount
                of your anticipated transaction (placing a temporary "hold" on the funds). If for some reason we are
                unable to confirm your booking, you will not be charged and we will request that such hold be released
                by your credit or debit card bank; until then, funds subject to the hold will not be available to you
                for other purposes.

                d. If your credit card is declined for any reason, we will notify you within 72 hours. Simply submitting
                the credit card does not automatically guarantee ticketing.

                e. Cosmos Holiday bears no responsibility in the event your credit or debit card is not approved or
                charged.

                f. There can be many reasons why your credit or debit card may not have been approved or charged.
                Examples of these maybe: airline could not confirm the booking, fare increased since payment information
                was submitted and prior to ticketing; or sufficient funds not available on the credit card. In such
                instances where the fare may have increased, you will be provided with alternate options and you have
                the right to cancel the booking at no cost to you. When the booking is ticketed at the cost originally
                quoted to you the ticket becomes non-refundable and non-cancellable.

                g. Cosmos Holiday uses stringent safety measures for credit card payment processing. Fraudulent
                transactions, if any, are reported to airport security, airlines and other law enforcement.

                h. You agree to be liable for any and all credit card payments and you agree not to dispute charges
                after the purchase has been made and your tickets and/or other products have been delivered by email
                confirmation or have been shipped to you. You agree to reimburse Cosmos Holiday in cases of charge back
                or credit card disputes where you have genuinely purchased a service on our website.

                i. Most credit card transactions over the phone to our Customer Service Department are recorded and are
                available as evidence in case of any dispute.

                j. Online credit card transactions are authorized at the time a user or anyone acting on their behalf
                accepts these Terms & Conditions and continues with the purchase.

                k. When certain transactions are determined to be high risk by our systems, we will not process such
                transactions unless our credit card verification team has determined that it's safe to process them. In
                order to establish validity of such transactions, we may contact you or your bank.

                l. After the full payment, due to an unforeseen and uncontrollable issue if it is not possible to hand
                over the product within the stipulated time, the company will notify the customers by phone, SMS, e-mail
                or other means within 48 hours of the placement of orders. The money has to be refunded in full within a
                maximum of 72 hours for any delivery failure. Company must not force the clients directly or indirectly
                to buy any other product in exchange.

                m. If the buyers make the payment in advance through debit and credit cards, bank transfer or mobile
                banking, the money has to be refunded in full in the same medium the payment was received within a
                maximum of 10 days for any delivery failure within the stipulated time. In this case, if any charge is
                applicable, the seller will be responsible to pay for it. The seller will notify the buyers by phone,
                SMS, e-mail or other means regarding the refund. Moreover, the seller cannot refund more than the amount
                the buyer has paid earlier. The time line could be relaxed if the buyer fails to receive the product or
                service in stipulated time.



                Credit Card Declines

                declined. The fare and any other booking details are not guaranteed. If your credit card declines at the
                time of processing your transaction, we will make all efforts to notify you by email within 72 hours.

                overseas travel. Your Travel Manager can provide you with general information about the travel insurance
                options available to you. It is your responsibility to ensure you have adequate travel insurance for
                your journey. To take out travel insurance through us, please contact your Travel Manager.



                Health

                You must ensure that you are aware of any health requirements and recommended precautions relevant to
                your travel and ensure that you carry all necessary vaccination documentation. In some cases, failure to

                specialist vaccination clinic before commencing your travel. For more information, please contact your

                Amendment and Cancellation Fees

                Cancelled bookings may incur charges. These charges can be up to 100% of the cost of the booking,
                regardless of whether travel has commenced. Fees and extra charges may also apply where a booking is
                changed and when tickets or documents are re-issued. Where we incur any liability for a supplier
                cancellation fee or charge for any booking which you cancel, you agree to indemnify us for the amount of
                that fee or charge. Where you seek a refund for a cancelled booking for which payment has been made to
                the supplier, we will not provide a refund to you until we receive the funds from that supplier.



                Taxes

                Airline taxes are subject to change and are confirmed at the time your airline ticket is issued or
                re-issued. There may also be a local tax charged at some airports.



                Agency

                We act as an agent only. We sell various travel related products as agent on behalf of numerous
                transport, accommodation and other service providers, such as airlines, coach, hotel, rail ticket, Bus
                Ticket and cruise line operators, and as agent for all of our wholesalers. Our obligation to you is to
                (and you expressly authorise us to) make travel bookings as agent on your behalf and to arrange relevant
                contracts between you and travel service providers. We have no responsibility for these services nor do
                we make or give any warranty or representation regarding their standard. All bookings are made on your
                behalf subject to the terms and conditions and limitations of liability imposed by these service
                providers. We can provide you with copies of the relevant service provider terms and conditions on
                request. Your legal recourse for travel services is against the specific provider and, except to the
                extent a problem is caused by fault on our part, not against us. Specifically, if for any reason
                (excluding fault on our part), any travel service provider is unable to provide the services for which
                you have contracted, your remedy lies against the provider and not with us.



                Liability

                To the extent permitted by law, we do not accept any liability in contract, tort or otherwise, for any
                injury, damage, loss (including consequential loss), delay, additional expense or inconvenience caused
                directly or indirectly by the acts, omissions or default, whether negligent or otherwise, of third party
                providers over whom we have no direct control, force majeure or any other event which is beyond our
                control or which is not preventable by reasonable diligence on our part. Our liability will also be
                limited to the extent that any relevant international conventions limit the amount of compensation which
                can be claimed for death, injury, or delay to passengers and loss, damage and delay to luggage. Under
                circumstances where our liability cannot be excluded and where liability may be lawfully limited, such
                liability is limited to the remedies required of us under applicable consumer laws.



                Special Requirements

                Please liaise with your Travel Manager regarding any special requirements you may have for your travel
                arrangements such as special meal and seating requests.

                Travel documents include (without limitation) airline tickets, hotel vouchers, tour vouchers or any
                other document (whether in electronic form or otherwise) used to confirm an arrangement with a service
                provider. Travel documents may be subject to certain conditions and/or restrictions including (without
                limitation) being non-refundable, non-date-changeable and subject to cancellation and/or amendment fees.
                Travel documents cannot be transferred to another person to use. All airline tickets must be issued in
                the name of the passport/photo identity holder. An incorrect name on a booking may result in an
                inability to use that booking and the booking being cancelled. Please review your travel documentation
                carefully and advise us immediately of any errors in names, dates and timings. You must ensure you have
                all your travel documents and e-tickets prior to travel. Please let us know if you believe you have not
                received any required documentation.



                Privacy Policy

                We are committed to protecting your personal information and agree to handle your personal information
                in accordance with our Privacy Policy. By providing personal information to us, you agree that our
                Privacy Policy will apply to how we handle your personal information and you consent to us collecting,
                using and disclosing your personal information as detailed in our Privacy Policy. In particular, you
                agree that in certain circumstances (such as where you request us to book international travel for you),
                we are permitted to disclose your personal information to overseas recipients. Such recipients may
                include the overseas travel service providers (e.g. airlines, accommodation or tour providers) with whom
                you make a booking. These travel service providers will in most cases receive your personal information
                in the country in which they will provide the services to you or in which their business is based. We
                may also disclose your personal information to our overseas related entities and to service providers
                who perform services for us within and outside of India. Generally, we will only disclose your personal
                information to these persons in connection with facilitation of your travel booking and/or to enable the
                performance of administrative and technical services by them on our behalf. Where we disclose your
                personal information to any person (including all overseas recipients), you agree that we will not be
                required to ensure that person’s compliance with Indian privacy laws or otherwise be accountable for how
                they handle your personal information. When used above, “disclose” includes to transfer, share, send, or
                otherwise make available or accessible to another person or entity.



                Governing Law

                If any dispute arises in relation to the agreement between you and us, the laws of Bangladesh will
                apply. You irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
                Bangladesh, and waive any right that you may have to object to an action being brought in those courts.



                Immigration-Related Information:

                Necessary immigration documents such as NOC, GO, RT-PCR Report, and Covid-19 Vaccine Certificate (Triple
                Dose) must be kept both in original and photocopy form (multiple copies for safety).

                Prior to traveling to any country (within 24/72 hours depending on the destination), it is the
                individual's responsibility to fill out the Arrival and Registration Form on the website or mobile app.
                After completion, print the feedback letter (in PDF format) and retain it (multiple copies for safety),
                and also capture a screenshot on your mobile device.

                Before returning to your home country at the conclusion of your trip (approximately 72 hours prior), you
                are required to fill out a Health Declaration Form Bangladesh. Print the feedback letter (in PDF format)
                and keep it with you or store it on your mobile device (if necessary).

                In the event of an increase in government-imposed travel taxes, the additional amount will be borne by
                the traveler as an increased tax burden.

                Transport and Travel Related Information:
                5. Travel dates are contingent upon the specified schedule and availability of flights/bus/trains/ships.
                6. "Cosmos Holiday" assumes no liability for any delays or cancellations of flights/bus/train/ship in
                any package tour.
                7. If there is a delay in departing from the transport terminal (bus/train/ship/air), it must be
                immediately communicated to 'Cosmos Holiday' authorities via email/text message/WhatsApp. If
                transportation is delayed at the destination (arrival terminal) due to pre-arranged time, in that case,
                the esteemed customer will have to arrange transportation to reach the destination at their respective
                hotel. 'Cosmos Holiday' will not bear any additional cost for this. However, if the cause and time of
                the delay are known in advance, 'Cosmos Holiday' will attempt to delay the receiving transport.
                8. Indian embassy fees, border fees, and all expenses including entry fees for T, sightseeing, travel
                taxes, etc., in the case of travel to India/Nepal/Bhutan by road, should be borne by the traveler.
                9, 'Cosmos Holidays' authorities are not responsible and cannot provide any assistance in case of loss
                of goods due to your negligence.
                10. Expenses for hospital/ambulance/medicine in the event of unexpected illness or accidents involving
                buses/trains/planes will be borne by the esteemed customer/family. In the unfortunate event of untimely
                death, the customer's family will have to bear all expenses and necessary arrangements to repatriate the
                deceased's body to the country. For this purpose, two close or blood-related individuals from the
                traveler's family must be nominated as guarantors to bear all these responsibilities.
                11. 'Cosmos Holidays' is not responsible for seat assignments, whether in the front or back, in relation
                to flight/bus/train/ship tickets.
                12. When booking tickets for flights/buses/trains/ships with connections or alongside another mode of
                transport, please be responsible for knowing the transit time and exercise caution during the tour.
                Otherwise, 'Cosmos Holiday' will not be liable for any cancellations/postponements/advancements of
                flights/buses/trains/ships/hotels and other scheduled facilities. In such cases, all affected services
                must be repurchased immediately at the current market price, with the customer bearing the additional
                cost.
                13. If additional accommodation and meals are required due to changes in the schedule of
                flights/buses/trains/ships (cancellations/postponements/advancements of any of the scheduled times), the
                customer must bear the cost through additional payment.
                14. In private/group tours, if you wish to have or have any meal outside the designated meal, payment
                must be made immediately by the traveler. Note that no mineral water or any soft drink is provided or
                served with the meal.
                15. In the case of group tours, passengers who have paid the full fare in advance can choose bus seats
                for inter-country bus travel (subject to seat availability). In internal tours, seat rotation is
                implemented to ensure fairness and equal opportunities for all group members.
                16. In private or group tours, all travelers must arrive at the terminal of the plane/bus/train/ship
                within the scheduled time. Also, they must arrive before the scheduled departure time for daily
                sightseeing tours. 'Cosmos Holidays' is not responsible for non-arrival or missed transportation. If a
                traveler misses the bus/train/air/ship during a change of destination (from one city to another), they
                must reach the destination at their own expense to continue the tour.
                17. Regularly check the day-to-day travel information on all tours and take necessary actions
                independently. It is not the guide's responsibility to wake someone up or carry them to the vehicle, so
                travelers should take initiative to ensure a pleasant trip without inconveniencing others.
                18. For any land package tour (included in private/group tours), each person is allowed one bag weighing
                a maximum of 30 kg and measuring 25-29 inches in length and 14-18 inches in width, and one hand-carry
                bag weighing a maximum of 7-10 kg with dimensions of 22 inches in length, 18 inches in width, and 10
                inches in height. Extra charges apply for additional weight or oversized baggage, requiring a larger
                vehicle.
                19. In different tour packages (Private Car, Jeep, Microbus, Bus, Tempo Traveler, Ferry, Ship, Dinner
                Cruise, Dhow Cruise, Marine Cruise), seat allocation is not under 'Cosmos Holidays' control, therefore
                'Cosmos Holidays' shall not be liable for any defects in the provided services. However, immediate
                written notification through email/text message/WhatsApp allows 'Cosmos Holiday' authorities to make
                efforts to resolve the issue.
                20. In travel to hilly/difficult areas where lunch or dinner will be provided at any quality hotel, some
                time may be required for management.

                Office and other documents:
                21. During office hours (10:00 am to 6:30 pm), except on public holidays, collect all necessary travel
                documents at your own risk. 'Cosmos Holidays' will not be liable if the office or office building is
                closed, resulting in the inability to deliver your passport or missing your flight/bus and canceling
                other related activities/tours.
                22. Before leaving 'Cosmos Holiday' office, carefully check that your name, date, time, and place are
                correct on the flight ticket. No objections will be entertained after the documents are handed over to
                you.
                23. Before departure, please take all services related to your tour (included and excluded) in writing
                (tour confirmation letter) to avoid any inconvenience during the trip. Oral assurances or instructions
                are not valid, and no services outside the contract are possible.
                24. Cosmos Holidays does not endorse purchasing advance tickets before acquiring the visa. If someone
                buys tickets before obtaining the visa and subsequently fails to acquire it, the responsibility lies
                with the buyer.
                25. Tickets and other documentation for certain tours, including group tours (bus, train, Jahang Air
                tickets, various vouchers), will be provided either one day before the tour commences or on the date of
                travel.
                26. Provide two active phone numbers (one personal and one emergency, connected via WhatsApp) to Cosmos
                Holiday authorities when booking or purchasing a package. You may need to communicate with Cosmos
                Holiday authorities in case of emergencies or to confirm your travel. If the provided number is lost or
                the registration is canceled, promptly inform the Cosmos Holiday authorities and provide an alternate
                number.
                27. Behave courteously with service-oriented individuals such as guides, waiters, and drivers at hotels
                during private/group tours, and offer them respectful tips or gratuities at your own discretion. This
                will enhance your image and the reputation of the country.

                Prohibition and Legal Policy:
                28. Consumption of intoxicants or alcohol (liquor) and engagement in any anti-social activities are
                strictly prohibited during the tour. If found guilty of such actions, the tour will be canceled with the
                consensus of all tour members, and travel expenses will be fully refunded.
                29. During any package tour, especially group tours, participants must not carry small parcels or
                luggage for other group members, guides, drivers, or strangers. Cosmos Holiday authorities will not bear
                responsibility for any illegal items found in carried luggage, nor for any ensuing legal complications.
                Individuals found in possession of illegal goods will be expelled from the group.
                30. Tourist guides hold an honorary position. Some guides, alongside their educational roles, may work
                part-time or out of passion. Therefore, interact with them politely and refrain from any embarrassing
                behavior.
                31. Avoid behaviors that compromise your personality or ostracize you during a group tour. For instance,
                refrain from showing excessive interest in other group members, knocking on room doors, offering
                unwanted food, suggesting shopping trips, or taking photos/videos without permission.
                32. Always adhere to the instructions of the group leader, follow the guide, and inform the group leader
                of your whereabouts. Ensure timely completion of sightseeing activities and adherence to tour schedules
                to avoid inconveniencing others. If someone fails to arrive within the specified time, the group will
                proceed without them, and no objections will be entertained.
                33. In the realm of breakfast arrangements, it is not permissible to gather additional food items
                tailored to individual needs in packets or bags.
                34. In the event of alterations to travel dates (tour plans) post-package booking, a minimum service
                charge of Rs 2,500 per person or higher, based on the package, must be settled. Additionally,
                cancellation charges for hotel bookings and a minimum of 25% or more of the total package price must be
                paid as an extra fee.
                35. When making payments, carefully review the receipt and ensure the preservation of the original copy.
                'Cosmos Holidays' retains full authority to modify or cancel packages at any given time.
                36. Customers opting for budget packages are not entitled to raise any objections. Budget packages are
                structured with minimum standards for hotels, transportation, and other services, hence ensuring cost
                efficiency across all aspects, be it hotel quality, location, or mode of transportation.
                37. Amendments to air tickets or any segment of the tour (tour reduction/extension/date change) are not
                permitted during the tour. If feasible, any extra charges incurred due to tour-related changes require
                prior consent from 'Cosmos Holiday' authorities, failing which 'Cosmos Holiday' disclaims responsibility
                for any ensuing complications.
                38. Prior to booking a package, it is imperative to thoroughly comprehend both the inclusions and
                exclusions of the package, meticulously reading through the printed terms and conditions. Any claims or
                objections post-booking will not be entertained.
                39. Following the purchase/booking of a tour package, during peak seasons (Eid, Puja, Christmas, New
                Year, Special Holidays), or instances of a surge in the dollar rate leading to increased fares for
                hotels, flights, buses, trains, and ships due to various factors, customers will be subject to
                additional charges.
                40. Changes to travel dates or tour plans cannot be facilitated via telephone/mobile. In such instances,
                customers must either visit the office directly or communicate in writing via email/text
                message/WhatsApp.
                41. All tours (international) include airport pick-up and drop-off at specific times. For flights
                arriving between 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM due to delays or changes, additional charges for late-night
                receptions or waiting until the scheduled time at the airport (Airport Receive-Drop Time) will be
                applicable.
                42. For package tours to various European countries including Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Umrah packages,
                the air ticket and package price must be paid in full upfront, which is non-refundable.
                43. Settlement of all dues payable to the bank through checks (clearance) is required 10-21 days prior
                to the commencement of the travel period (bank working days).
                44. Payment for travel package booking must be settled in full or 75% of the package value within 3 to 7
                days of booking, with the remaining balance to be paid. Immediate full payment is required for near-term
                travel dates. Failure to pay outstanding dues may result in price increases (for purchased packages,
                hotels, tickets, etc.) or the cancellation of all services.
                45. Tickets and hotel/tour vouchers will be issued within 72 hours prior to travel, following the full
                payment of the contract to confirm the travel arrangements.
                46. The authority shall not be liable in the event of a reduction/change/cancellation/extra night stay
                of the tour due to any natural calamity, political disturbance, or mechanical fault of the transport.
                All expenses incurred shall be borne by the customer.
                47. If there is a change in the number of travelers after the package price is determined, the package
                price may increase accordingly.
                48. If any traveler is found with illegal goods during the scheduled package tour, resulting in police
                involvement, the tour for that individual will be immediately canceled. Cosmos Holidays will not assume
                any responsibility, and the entire amount payable against the package will not be refunded.
                49. In hilly areas, air-conditioned (AC) vehicles will not be operational.
                50. Any travel-related issues must be promptly reported to the local agent of Cosmos Holidays or
                directly to the authorities of Cosmos Holidays. Otherwise, no complaints will be entertained.
                51. For online bookings/purchases, no date changes, cancellations, or refunds are possible for
                hotel/tour packages.
                52. Room sharing (Staying) without a valid family identity is not permitted.
                53. Select the services included in your package and carefully choose your hotel. Familiarize yourself
                with the hotel's quality beforehand by visiting their website. No complaints will be entertained during
                the journey.

                Accommodation Related Information:
                54. Maintain a cheerful disposition and mutual understanding with unfamiliar roommates in twin or triple
                sharing rooms during group tours. Keep valuable items (both domestic and foreign currency, jewelry,
                mobile phones, cameras, laptops, etc.) under your own supervision. Any theft or loss of belongings will
                not be the responsibility of Cosmos Holidays. To mitigate unpleasant situations (if you prefer not to
                take risks), consider using a single room for an additional fee.
                55. Twin sharing rooms are typically utilized for group tours. In cases where a customer is traveling
                alone or in odd-numbered groups, room allocation will be subject to certain conditions. These conditions
                are as follows:
                (a) If traveling alone, Cosmos Holidays will attempt to pair you with a same-gender roommate; however,
                if unsuccessful, you will be charged for a single room.
                (b) In instances where there are three single customers (of the same gender), triple sharing rooms will
                be allocated. Since triple sharing rooms have one mattress bed, the allocation of beds will be
                determined through arbitration or lottery among the occupants. Otherwise, two occupants will be assigned
                to twin sharing rooms, and the remaining individual will have the option to purchase a single room for
                an additional fee. All decisions, including lottery selections, will be made by Cosmos Holidays.
                56. Cosmos Holiday does not assume responsibility for the quality, service, or location of hotels.
                Please conduct thorough research on the preferred hotel and its location on the website at your own
                discretion.
                57. International hotel check-in typically begins at 3/4 PM, with check-out at 11:00 AM. If you arrive
                early in the morning or depart in the morning, you may wait in the hotel lobby until the designated
                check-in time (which is usually at 12:00 PM or 4:00 PM). Similarly, if your return transportation is
                scheduled for the afternoon, evening, or night, ensure that check-out is completed by 11:00 AM. In such
                cases, you may wait in the hotel lobby or leave your luggage and explore outside.
                58. Complimentary breakfast is usually provided by the hotel between 7:00 AM/8:00 AM and 9:00 AM/9:30
                AM. Cosmos Holidays will not be held accountable for missed breakfast in the event of early departure
                from the hotel at 5:00 AM/6:00 AM due to bus/train/ship/air travel for any tour.
                59. In hotel rooms, an extra mattress is often provided for triple sharing arrangements, which may
                reduce the available space. Cosmos Holidays is not responsible for this. If desired, you may opt for a
                larger room or a family suite for an additional fee, subject to negotiation.
                60. In many cases, hotel rooms may have reduced space. Cosmos Holidays is not responsible for this
                occurrence.
                61. Bathroom and room amenities are typically provided free of charge in hotel rooms; however, there may
                be exceptions. Cosmos Holidays will not be held responsible if these items are not provided by the
                hotel.
                62. When leaving the hotel, do not solely rely on hotel staff to transport luggage to and from the
                vehicle, as this is done at your own risk. Similarly, when using bus/train/ship transportation, handle

                on your part, and it is essential to take every precaution to prevent any inconvenience to other tour
